# Solar Farm Data Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This project is a data analysis dashboard for solar farm data. It uses Streamlit, a fast and easy way to build data apps in Python, to create an interactive web application that performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on solar farm data from different countries.

## Features
- Summary statistics of the data
- Data quality checks
- Time series analysis
- Correlation analysis
- Wind analysis
- Temperature analysis
- Histograms, box plots, and scatter plots

## Installation
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the necessary packages using pip:

   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the Streamlit app:

## Usage
After running the Streamlit app, navigate to the local URL displayed in your terminal. Use the sidebar to select a country and the dashboard will display the corresponding EDA.

## Data
The data used in this project is stored in CSV files located in the `data` directory. Each file contains solar farm data for a specific country.
